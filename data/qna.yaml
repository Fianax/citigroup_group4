  - context: |
      Citi’s Overdraft Protection policy allows customers to link eligible accounts to cover overdrafts. 
      This service is designed to help prevent declined transactions or returned checks due to insufficient funds. 
      Fees may apply, and the coverage is subject to the bank’s discretion. Customers can enable overdraft protection 
      through online banking or by visiting a branch. The bank may limit the number of transfers per month, and 
      overdraft fees vary depending on the account type. In some cases, Citi may offer grace periods for overdraft 
      repayment before applying penalties.

      Customers who enroll in overdraft protection should carefully review their linked accounts to ensure sufficient 
      balances. If the linked account does not have enough funds, the overdraft transaction may still be declined. 
      Citi provides notifications via email and mobile banking when an account is overdrawn, giving customers an 
      opportunity to deposit funds. 

      Overdraft protection does not guarantee approval of all transactions. If an account remains negative beyond 
      a certain period, additional penalties may apply, and continued negative balances may lead to account 
      restrictions or closure. Customers should monitor their accounts regularly and use budgeting tools to manage 
      their balances effectively.
