No fiduciary, quasi-fiduciary or other special relationship exists between you and us. We owe you a duty of ordinary care. Any internal policies or procedures that we may maintain in excess of reasonable commercial standards and general banking usage are solely for our own benefit and shall not impose a higher standard of care than otherwise would apply in their absence.

Unlike individual or joint accounts, this account is intended to manage the financial affairs of the estate and requires additional documentation for its opening.

      - question: |
          What defines an Individual Account?
        answer: |
          An Individual Account is owned solely by one person. It is not shared with any other individual, and all decisions and responsibilities regarding the account rest with the account holder.

      - question: |
          How does a Joint Account work, and what happens if one account holder dies?
        answer: |
          A Joint Account is shared between two or more individuals, and it operates under joint tenancy. If one account holder dies, the ownership of the account automatically passes to the surviving account holder(s). All joint account holders are jointly responsible for the account's activity, including any overdrafts. If there's a dispute, Citibank may require all account holders to act together for any instructions or transactions.

  - context: |
      Applicable to accounts opened on or after April 23, 2021
      All Joint Accounts must have at least one adult owner. Minors age 13 to 17 may qualify to open a Joint Account. Please refer to the governing state law of your account for information about legal rights and obligations of minors. When at least one owner of a Joint Account is a minor in the Basic Banking Package, the adult owner should serve as the primary signer which means the adult owner will receive communications and statements regarding the account according to the Client Manual - Consumers Accounts and Marketplace Addendum (for instance, see 'Account Statements and Notices,' 'Periodic Statements'). Unless expressly limited, the Joint Account rules explained in the Client Manual - Consumer Accounts and Marketplace Addendum otherwise remain unchanged.
      'In-Trust-For ('ITF') Account' means an account where you designate another person as beneficiary of the account. You can open an individual or joint ITF account as long as it is not a checking account. The beneficiary receives the funds in the account only upon the death of all account owners and cannot make any withdrawals or account changes before that time. If more than one beneficiary is named in our records, they will share equally in the account proceeds. During the lifetime of one or more of the account owners, this account will be treated as an individual account or joint account, as applicable. To change the beneficiary, all account owners must sign our documentation naming the new beneficiary.
    
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Can minors open a Joint Account at Citibank?
        answer: |
          Yes, minors aged 13 to 17 may qualify to open a Joint Account, but at least one adult owner must also be listed. The adult owner will serve as the primary signer and will receive account communications and statements. State law governs the legal rights and obligations of minors regarding such accounts.

      - question: |
          What is an In-Trust-For (ITF) Account, and how does it work?
        answer: |
          An ITF Account is an account where you designate a beneficiary who will receive the funds after all account owners pass away. The beneficiary cannot make withdrawals or changes to the account during the owners' lifetimes. If multiple beneficiaries are named, they will share the account proceeds equally. The account is treated as an individual or joint account while the owners are alive.

      - question: |
          How can I change the beneficiary on my In-Trust-For (ITF) Account?
        answer: |
          To change the beneficiary on your ITF Account, all account owners must sign the necessary documentation naming the new beneficiary. This ensures that the new beneficiary will receive the account funds after the death of the account owners.

      Applicable to accounts opened on or after April 23, 2021
      'Trust Account' means an account owned by a trust. In some cases, the trust must have its own Taxpayer Identification Number issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Additional documentation is required to open the account.
      'Uniform Transfers to Minors Account' ('UTMA Account') means an account where, pursuant to state law, an adult makes an irrevocable gift of the funds to a minor individual. The adult, as custodian, controls and manages the account for the benefit of the minor until adulthood. The definition of a minor varies by state; however, generally, one custodian and one minor are allowed per account, unless the account is established under Maryland's UTMA rules. We act only upon the custodian's instructions. Citibank may, in its sole discretion, opt to block or close the UTMA account if it determines or has reason to believe that the minor has attained the age at which the UTMA terminates under applicable state law. Although Citibank may terminate the UTMA in this circumstance, Citibank is not responsible to monitor age or eligibility for an UTMA account, even though our records may include the minor's date of birth. It is the custodian's responsibility to properly distribute the funds in the account upon the minor's death or attainment of age at which the UTMA terminates under applicable state law. You may wish to consult your tax advisor or attorney before opening a UTMA Account.

          What is a Trust Account at Citibank, and how is it different from other types of accounts?

          A Trust Account is owned by a trust, and in some cases, the trust must have its own Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) issued by the IRS. Additional documentation is required to open a Trust Account, and it is distinct from personal or business accounts as it holds assets for the benefit of beneficiaries according to the terms of the trust.

          What is a Uniform Transfers to Minors Account (UTMA), and who manages the funds?
        answer: |
          A UTMA Account allows an adult to make an irrevocable gift of funds to a minor, with the adult acting as the custodian. The custodian controls and manages the account for the minor until they reach adulthood. The minor cannot control the account until the legal age defined by state law.

      - question: |
          What happens if a minor reaches the age at which a UTMA Account terminates under state law?
        answer: |
          If the minor reaches the age at which the UTMA Account terminates under applicable state law, Citibank may close or block the account. However, it is the custodian's responsibility to properly distribute the funds and ensure compliance with state law. Citibank is not responsible for monitoring the minor’s age or eligibility for the UTMA account.
