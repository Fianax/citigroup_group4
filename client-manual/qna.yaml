      ## Account Statements and Notices, Periodic Statements

      We will provide a periodic account statement to you showing all activity for the statement period, all transactions made with your Citibank® Banking Card, all transfers you authorize in advance, and other account information for the statement period. 
      Your periodic statement will include a summary of your linked account balances and an itemized listing of your transactions by date, including information about checks presented against your account, and other notices about your linked accounts. 
      We use postage-paid ordinary postal-mail to send you statements or notices to the postal mail address reflected in our records for the account.

      Regardless of the number of account owners, we only mail to one owner per account. 
      Notification given to any one account owner is considered notification to all account owners and is considered delivered to you on the date we first place the statement or notice in the U.S. mail or the date that the email notifying you that your statement is available on Citibank Online is first sent, regardless of whether or not you receive it.

      If two consecutive statements and/or notices are returned to us for any reason, you agree that we may hold subsequent notices and statements until we receive forwarding information from you. 
      Statements and notices held for you will be deemed delivered to you on the date that they are prepared (for held statements), mailed (for returned statements) or otherwise made available to you. 
      At our discretion, we may destroy mail that is returned to us as determined to be undeliverable. 
      If you have a checking, Checking Plus®, or Checking Plus® (variable rate) line of credit account, you will receive a statement each month and that statement will include information regarding all of your other linked accounts.

      You can arrange to receive separate statements for your linked Citibank accounts by calling CitiPhone Banking® (see the 'Contact Us' section of this Manual for telephone numbers).

      Instead of receiving a paper statement through ordinary postal mail, any signer on an account may elect to enroll in our paperless statement service when you are registered on Citibank Online. 
      If you elect to use the paperless statement service, we will notify you via email of the availability of your statement on Citibank Online. 
      The terms and conditions for the paperless statement service are subject to a separate agreement which you will accept when enrolling in the service and can view at any time on Citibank Online.

      ## Substitute Checks and Your Rights
      ### What Is a Substitute Check?
      A substitute check is a paper reproduction created from a digital image of the front and back of the original check and bears the legend 'This is a legal copy of your check.' You can use it the same way you would use the original check. Federal law allows banks to replace original checks with 'substitute checks.' Under the law, a substitute check is the 'legal equivalent' of the original check. In other words, it can be used in the same way and for all purposes for which you would use the original check.

      ## Substitute Checks and Your Rights
      ### Your Rights

      The following rights apply if you receive a substitute check from us in lieu of the original check. These rights do not apply to original checks or to electronic debits. Your rights as to those transactions remain unchanged and are described in other sections of this Agreement. Please note these rights also do not apply to images of checks furnished to you or viewed through Citibank® Online.

      In certain cases, federal law provides a special procedure that allows you to request a refund for losses you incur if you believe a substitute check is incorrectly posted to your account (for example, if you think your account was debited for the wrong amount) and production of the original check is needed to determine the validity of the debit. The losses you may attempt to recover may include the amount that was withdrawn from your account and fees that were charged as a result of the withdrawal (for example, overdraft check fees.) The amount of the refund you may request under this procedure is limited to the amount of your loss or the amount of the substitute check, whichever is less. You are also entitled to interest if your account is an interest-bearing account. If your loss exceeds the amount of the substitute check, you may be able to recover additional amounts under other laws.

      Under federal law, you may receive up to $2,500 of your refund (plus interest if you have an interest-bearing account) within ten (10) Business Days after we receive a complete claim from you and the remainder of your refund not later than forty-five (45) calendar days after we receive a complete claim from you. You will not be entitled to a refund if we determine that the substitute check was correctly posted to your account. Alternatively, we may reverse the refund (including any interest on the refund) if we later determine that the substitute check was correctly posted to your account.
